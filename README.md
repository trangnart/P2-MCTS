# P2-MCTS
Ziyuan Wang Trang Tran
This programming assignment implements, in Python, a bot that plays Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). It will:

#2 Using the existing implementation from mcts_vanilla.py as base code, implement mcts_modified.py with the addition of our own heuristic rollout strategy as an improvement over vanilla MCTS. 

#3 Perform the two experiments described below.
